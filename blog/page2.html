     <p>This is the first of two articles on GADTs. This first part will be a general introduction to GADTs and their utility, while the second part will show how we can wrangle GADT behaviour out of C#.</p>
<p>The canonical GADT introduction involves a demonstration of the inadequacy of algebraic data types. But since this is written from a C# perspective, and C# doesn’t have GADTs, we’ll start with a brief introduction to vanilla ADTs.</p>
<h2 id="algebraic-data-types">Algebraic Data Types</h2>
<p>Algebraic data types allow us a sort of type-level composition that’s more rigorous than what we have in C#. There are two ways to compose types in this algebra: products and sums, which are roughly analogous<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to products and sums over the integers.</p>
<h3 id="product-types">Product types</h3>
<p>Product types allow us to combine two or more types into one compound type. In Haskell, we can combine two types into a pair:</p>

     <p>This episode, we’ll be looking at why <code>SelectMany</code> will look so strange to Haskell users, why that’s linked to some implementation-level issues with C#, and the extremely cool way that the C# team got around those issues.</p>
<p>A quick recap: LINQ query syntax is actually just Haskell do-notation, specialized for the list monad.</p>
<p>We can see this by looking at the signature for <code>SelectMany</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java">IEnumerable&lt;B&gt; SelectMany&lt;A, B&gt;(
  <span class="kw">this</span> IEnumerable&lt;A&gt; source,
  Func&lt;A, IEnumerable&lt;B&gt;&gt; selector
)</code></pre></div>
<p>It’s a less polymorphic Haskell bind:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">bind ::</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> m <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> m a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m b</code></pre></div>
<p>When I first saw this, I immediately attempted to write my own monad instance in C#, and had a Bad Time. But figuring out why it wasn’t so easy was probably more interesting than writing the monad instances in the first place!</p>

     <p>In this installment of <em>Fun with Functional C#</em>, we’re going to be implementing the reader monad, and attempting to figure out if it’s actually useful. The reader monad was the first monad I implemented when I found out that <code>SelectMany</code> was <code>bind</code>. I thought it would be a good way to get rid of runtime dependency injection errors, but it turned out not to be the panacea I’d hoped for.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was implement <code>SelectMany</code>, but it had some quirks that I’ll discuss in the next installment of this series. For now, let’s just look at the implementation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span class="kw">public</span> <span class="kw">class</span> Reader&lt;E, A&gt;
{
    <span class="kw">private</span> Func&lt;E, A&gt; f;
    <span class="kw">public</span> Reader(Func&lt;E, A&gt; func) 
    {
        f = func;
    }

    <span class="kw">public</span> A <span class="fu">RunReader</span>(E env) 
    {
        <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="fu">f</span>(env);
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This is basically equivalent to</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">newtype</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> e a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> {<span class="ot"> runReader ::</span> (e <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a) }</code></pre></div>

     <p>With the introduction of LINQ in C#3, Erik Meijer and co. rebranded monads and presented them to a huge audience, and I think the way they did it was a brilliant piece of programming language UX design.</p>
<p>Apparently, before Erik Meijer joined the team working on LINQ, their goal was just to reduce the impedance mismatch between SQL databases and C#. So the solution they came up with was to let developers query SQL databases by writing SQL queries directly within C#- basically a language-level ORM.</p>
<p>I guess someone must have pointed out, wait a minute, there’s also the same impedance mismatch when you’re interacting with XML data- why are we limiting ourselves to relational databases?</p>
<p>And then Erik Meijer came along<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and said, query comprehension can be represented as a monad, so we can do all these things, and make it work for in-memory objects too, and reactive streams, and any queryable we can think of!</p>
<p>Now Pandora’s Monad<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is open, the M-word is floating around the hallways and people are getting into heated discussions about the Yoneda Lemma and the co-Yoneda lemma. Your coworkers are saying, look at Haskell, these problems have been <em>solved</em> in a general way for years!</p>
<p>It must have been tempting to just blindly retrofit functional concepts into C# and tell developers to just <code>fmap</code> and <code>fold</code> and <code>bind</code> to their heart’s content. But they didn’t, because immediately grasping the utility of these concepts is almost impossible at first glance, so they stuck a particular abstraction level and stuck with it. I guess a part of it could have been that C#’s type system can’t actually represent monads, but to me it looked like a concious design decision to solve the problem at an appropriate level of abstraction.</p>

     <p>I use MathJax on this blog. It’s a great tool, but it’s really slow, and worse, it’s slow in a way that draws attention to itself. A page with even a bit of MathJax will go through these stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Unrendered MathJax markup</li>
<li>Initial render with incorrect font</li>
<li>Render with correct font, but with incorrect spacing and alignment</li>
<li>Render correctly</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire process can take a few seconds, and it’s rather jarring to watch text reflow at each stage as MathJax renders.</p>
<p>Khan Academy has noticed this problem, so it’s developed an alternative called <a href="https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX">KaTeX</a>, which can render at many times the speed of MathJax. Unfortunately, it only implements a <a href="https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/wiki/Function-Support-in-KaTeX">small subset</a> of MathJax’s functionality, and I wanted to draw commutative diagrams, which weren’t supported. Even quite basic things like <code>\begin{split}</code> <a href="https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/208">aren’t yet supported</a>, so I’m stuck with MathJax for the time being.</p>
