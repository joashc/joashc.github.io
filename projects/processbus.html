<p>This is an abstraction layer over <a href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/">LanguageExt.Process</a> for declaratively specifying service bus messaging topologies. It was really an excuse to use LanguageExt and see how far you could take the functional style in C#- I actually began writing it in Haskell and then “translating” it to C#.</p>
<p>It only works with LanguageExt.Process, but I found that the Redis persistence was far too slow to be useful over multiple machines. I might break out the declarative messaging topology part and make it work with arbitrary transport layers.</p>
