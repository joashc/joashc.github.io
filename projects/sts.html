<p>This application allows the visualisation of the stochastic properties of an arbitrary sequential study, helping investigators design and plan first-in-human trials whilst balancing patient safety and overall cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>It was initially implemented by our team in three days for Health Hack 2015. But because I wasnâ€™t happy with such a rushed job, I took a few days out to completely reimplement it using React and Redux. It was also an excuse to see undo/redo trivially implemented in the app, which I thought was pretty cool.</p>
