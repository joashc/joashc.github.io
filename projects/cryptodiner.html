<p>A Haskell implementation of Chaum’s dining cryptographers protocol, using \(Z_p^*\) Diffie-Hellman, for cryptographically secure anonymous communication. Uses STM to manage concurrency, and the whole thing is structured with the free monad. It currently uses a star-shaped network topology; I’m thinking of using a DHT to make it truly decentralised.</p>
