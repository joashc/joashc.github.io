<p>Android library that allows you to automatically crop white borders from images, according to LAB colour space deltas. It includes an extended ImageView that automatically crops images.</p>
<p>I wrote this because I was writing an application that displayed a lot of book cover images, which for some reason seem to always have an ugly white border around them.</p>
